# Sorting Algorithms

A **Sorting Algorithm** is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements in an order. For example, a given array \([10, 20, 5, 2]\) becomes \([2, 5, 10, 20]\) after sorting in increasing order and becomes \([20, 10, 5, 2]\) after sorting in decreasing order.

There exist different sorting algorithms for different types of inputs, such as:
- A binary array
- A character array
- An array with a large range of values
- An array with many duplicates
- A small vs large array

The algorithms may also differ according to output requirements, for example, stable sorting (which maintains the original order of equal elements) or non-stable sorting. Sorting is provided in the library implementation of most programming languages. These sorting functions typically are general-purpose functions with flexibility in providing the expected sorting order (increasing, decreasing, or by a specific key in the case of objects).
