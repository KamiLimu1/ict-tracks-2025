## ðŸ›  How to Use This Module

1. Start with `Logic & Loops` if you're new to conditionals and iteration.
2. Move to `Paradigms` to explore more abstract and reusable ways of structuring code.
3. Complete each assignment as you progress â€” they are designed to reinforce what you've learned.
4. Ask for help if you're stuck or unsure â€” this is foundational material for everything that comes next.
